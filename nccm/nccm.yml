#   ~/.config/nccm/nccm.yml
#   ~/.nccm.yml
#   ~/nccm.yml
#   /etc/nccm.yml
#
# Use the following format:
#   FRIENDLY_NAME:
#     user: USER_NAME
#     address: SERVER_ADDRESS
#     comment: FREETEXT_COMMENT
#     keepalive: KEEPALIVE_TIME

#       FREETEXT_COMMENT - Any freetext you like to store as a comment on this connection (optional field)
